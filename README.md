# EngDrom

The EngDrom project is a school project that is due for april 2023. The idea is to create a game engine in Java using OpenGL as a graphic library.

We plan the following things to be done until the deadline if we can, if we can't then sad but it's ok :
 - UI System X
 - File system X
 - Mesh placement X
 - JDrom and dev support X
 - Material editing X
 - Packaging a project and releasing it X

We are currently working on the UI System, here are the milestones for this :
 - Default OpenGL system X
 - Component system X
 - Components X
   - Navbar
   - File system component
   - Overview component
   - World mesh list component
   - Inspector tools component
 - Many windows system (not like windows but like in firefox you can have a few pages) X

# And what about coding ?

During your experience in EngDrom, we would like to introduce you to JDromadaire, a project we did during the 2021 lockdown and we would like to implement as the default language support for EngDrom. You can find the default repository at https://github.com/MrThimote/JDromadaire/. In the future we plan to rewrite JDrom so that we can implement it easier in the engine and to get better error

# Can i colaborate ?

As this is a school project, you won't be able to collaborate on it until we present it to our teachers. But after april 2023 if we see that people are interessed in the engine, we might continue supporting it.

# Credits

The name comes as for JDrom from the dromadaire team in the Alkindi contest which we were part of in the year 2021. "Dromadaire" means camel in french and is a reference to one of the exercices in which we found randomly the answer which led to this name.
